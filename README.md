# CST369FitnessTracker
Little fitness tracker made while in CST 369 (Smartphone App Development) while at Roosevelt.

The user selects Biking, Walking, or Running and the amount of the activity. It then stores each of these on a RecyclerView. Persistence is
managed via SharedPreferences w/ Gson library for the custom objects.
